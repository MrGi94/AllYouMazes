rotation parameter experiment 1 - wooden floor - epuck 2212

speed: 0.1
duration: 10s
degrees: 155° //did not exactely rotate on the spot thus not suggested
result = 15.5°/s

speed: 0.2
duration: 10s
degrees: 345°
result = 34.5°/s

speed: 0.3
duration: 10s
degrees: 515°
result = 51.5°/s

speed: 0.4
duration: 10s
degrees: 690°
result = 69°/s

speed: 0.5
duration: 10s
degrees: 875°
result = 87.5°/s

speed: 1
duration: 10s
degrees: 1745°
result = 174.5°/s

speed: 1.5
duration: 10s
degrees: 2650°
result = 265°/s

speed: 2
duration: 10s
degrees: 2645°
result = 264.5°/s

speed: 3
duration: 10s
degrees: 2645°
result = 264.5°/s

speed: 4
duration: 10s
degrees: 2655°
result = 265.5°/s

speed: 5
duration: 10s
degrees: 2655°
result = 265.5°/s

Fitting those values with a linear function we get the following:

y = 177.429*x - 1.745 with x being the rotation value and y being the actual °/s's. 
If we are interested in which rotation speed x to choose when we want a certain °/s y we can use the function: x = (y - 1.745)/177.429 .

Note that any rotation speed below 0.2 (and thus below 34.5°/s) is not suggested as the epuck has been observed to not rotate on the spot at this speed.

Also note the maximum rotation speed of 265.5°/s.

With a positive rotation speed the rotation will be counterclockwise and with a negative rotation speed the rotation will be clockwise.
